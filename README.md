# Lab 4: Grade API program

**Please try to work through Tasks 0 and 1 ahead of your lab time on Monday.
Your team and TA can help you during the lab if you had any trouble,
so don't worry if you don't get through Task 1 before lab. There will also
be some time to do this as your TA helps everyone get into teams.**

## Task 0: Fork and clone this repo

1. As with the previous lab activities, start by making a fork of this repo and cloning it.

## Task 1: Your API Token (token)

In order to use the Grade API, you will need to sign up a new username, and obtain an API `token`.
To sign up a username, we are going to make a simple request to the Grade API.

1. Go to https://hoppscotch.io. This is a tool like Postman, which can be used to quickly interact with APIs.
2. Beside the word GET, replace `https://echo.hoppscotch.io/` with `http://vm003.teach.cs.toronto.edu:20112/signUp`.

Next, we need to specify the username which we want to use. To do this, we add a parameter.

3. In the Parameters tab, choose `+ Add new` and set the parameter name to `username`.
4. For its value, choose whatever username you want to use. Make note of the name you choose, as you'll use it during the lab. (Don't worry, you can repeat this process with a new username if you need to later!)
5. Press the `Send` button to make the request. You may receive an error that the request didn't go through. Scroll down and select `proxy` as the middleware and press `Send` again. You should now see the result of the request.
6. If the username had been used before, you will see a response indicating that. Choose a new username and send the request again.
7. If the request is successfully sent, you will see a response that contains a `status_code` of value `200`. In this response, you will get two important fields: `token` and `environment_variables`, whose values you will need later on in the activity.

You can also refer to [the Grade API Postman Workspace](https://www.postman.com/cloudy-astronaut-813156/csc207-grade-apis-demo/overview) for the documentation of all API requests related to the Grade API.
Specifically, to learn more about the SignUp API request, refer to [this section of the workspace](https://www.postman.com/cloudy-astronaut-813156/csc207-grade-apis-demo/request/9huifpg/1-1-sign-up-when-a-username-is-available).

***

Alternative to the above: Enter `http://vm003.teach.cs.toronto.edu:20112/signUp?username=USERNAME` in any web browser
with `USERNAME` replaced with the username you want to use. Note, we are introducing you to tools like hoppscotch.io
and postman above, since we'll later see API requests which can't be made through your web browser.

***

7. Create a new file called `token.txt` in the root directory of your project and copy / paste the value you found
   for the `token` field in that file. This file is indicated in the `.gitignore` for your project, so
   its name will appear yellow in IntelliJ to indicate that git will ignore the file (it won't be version
   controlled). **This can be useful to ensure that you don't accidentally share private information
   (like personal API tokens) or configurations specific to your local environment when working on a
   team project.**

Now that you have your API token, the last step is to get your program to use it. To do so, we
are going to set an environment variable in the run configuration.

Note: at this point you should be able to run the program, but it is possible that the Maven
project didn't automatically build. If you have errors which won't let you run the code in the
next step, you may need to reload the Maven project. You can do this by right-clicking on the
`pom.xml` file in your project. In the context menu, choose `Maven -> reload project`. This _should_
resolve any errors. You may also need to go to `Project Structure...` and select your project JDK.

Important: make sure not to commit any changes to the `.idea/misc.xml` file, as it will store which specific JDK
you are using, which likely isn't the same as the rest of your team when you collaborate on the coding task later
in this lab.

8. Try running the main application (`src/main/java/app/gui/Application`). When you start the program,
you will see that it says `your token is null` (since we didn't set it yet).
Stop the program and go to `Run -> Edit Configurations...`.

9. Open the Run Configuration for `Application` and find the `Environment Variables:`
field.
    - Note: If you don't see this Run Configuration listed:
      - create a new Run Configuration of type `Application` (use the +
      in the top left corner of the window).
      - where it says "Main class", type `app.gui.Application`.

10. In that field, paste the text you copied from `environment_variables` when you sign up an account. Your `token` should also be in `token.txt`.
Example: `token=6SgDAt8XpnQYTDPt4vHcPCCKJ2ppLg1C`.
11. Click `Apply` and then `OK`.
12. Now, rerun the program and you should see your `token` displayed.
13. Click on the `Log Grade` button and in the next screen, enter `207` as the course, enter a valid grade for this course, and click `Log`. You should see a popup
telling you that your grade was successfully entered. You can then check your grade
by using the `Get Grade` menu and specifying your username and `207` for the course.

You are now ready to use the program! The following task will be completed with your
team during the lab. First, make sure everyone has successfully completed the steps above.

## Task 2: Forming a team

As a team-building exercise, you will now work together to form a team using
this application. Team members in this program are able to view the grades of other
team members.

1. Choose a team name. Make it something unique to your team, as other teams will also
be picking team names and duplicate names aren't allowed.

2. Have one member of your team form a team with the name your team chose by clicking the `Form a team` button,
entering the team name in the text field, and pressing `Submit`.

3. Each other member of the team should then join the team using the `Join a team` menu. Make sure you see the popup
confirming that you successfully joined the team.

4. Try looking up the grade another team member entered for `207` using the `Get a Grade` menu.

Now that you are all on the team, there are a couple coding tasks for your team to work on.

***

Note: If your team finds it convenient to work on parts of this lab on a common machine,
you can create different run configurations (copy an existing one) which each use a different
`token` environment variable. Then you can run multiple instances of the program and
enter requests as different users!

***

Note: Your team can choose how you want to work on the following two tasks, but below is our suggestion.

Suggested logistics: One of you should invite the others to collaborate on their fork of the
original repo on GitHub. You can do this in your repo on GitHub under `Settings -> Collaborators`.
This will allow you to push branches to a common repo and then use pull requests to contribute
your code and review. To prevent others from pushing directly to the main branch,
we recommend you set branch protection rules on GitHub. Below are how the settings might look if you
add branch protection rules:

![image of branch protection rules for main
with the requirement of two approvers to
merge in pull requests.](images/branch_protection_rules.png "branch protection rules")

We recommend splitting your team into two halves with one half working on task 3 and the other on task 4.
You can work on separate branches and merge the code together when you are done.
Note that successful completion of task 3 is a pre-requisite for task 4 as the `getMyTeam()` method is used in both the features,
but you can still write the code for task 4 so that it is ready to run once task 3 is complete.

## Task 3: Coding the Get Average Grade feature

While this program has some useful core functionality which is provided by the Grade API,
there are certain things which the Grade API can't currently do for us.

1. Go to `My Team` menu, enter the course name as `207` and click on `Get average grade`. You will notice that the functionality 
for `Get Average Grade` isn't implemented yet and this displays an error message. 
2. As a team, your goal is to work together to implement this feature and confirm that it works.
3. Follow the flow from the `getAverage` button defined in the UI layer (`app/gui/Application.java`) to reach until the 
`GetAverageGradeUseCase` in the usecase layer. You can do this by setting a breakpoint and running the program in debug mode.
4. You will need to finish implementing the logic of calculating the average grade (Task 3a in the code) in the `GetAverageGradeUseCase` class.
The logic is partly implemented, but what is written depends on the `getMyTeam` method (Task 3b in the code), which needs to be implemented.
Follow the hints provided in this method to complete its implementation.

You can run the provided tests to check if your "Task 3a" `GetAverageGradeUseCase` logic is implemented correctly, _before_ you finish implementing the "Task 3b" `MongoGradeDataBase.getMyTeam` method in Task 3.
These tests make use of the technique of mocking (or stubbing), where instead of calling the actual API we use fake data instead.
This is possible because of how the program is designed, with the `GradeDataBase` interface allowing us to replace any variable with reference type `GradeDataBase` with our own dummy implementation.

## Task 4: Coding the Get Top Grade feature

In this task, you are required to build a feature that will allow the user to get the top grade on their team for a given course.

1. Similar to `Get Average Grade`, you will need to implement the `Get Top Grade` feature.
2. However, in this feature, the `Get Top Grade` usecase is already implemented in the `GetTopGradeUseCase` class.
3. You will need to implement the UI layer for this feature by adding a button `Get Top Grade` in the `My Team` menu.
You can draw inspiration from the `Get Average Grade` button.

## Task 5 Bonus

If your team finishes the above tasks and has extra time, we encourage you to think of an
additional use case that can be implemented using this Grade API.
Implement this use case end-to-end, from the UI layer to the UseCase layer, and see if you can get it working.
This will be good practice for when your team starts developing your own course project where you will also be using an API endpoint. 

## Tips
1. Use this API `info` if you want to access all the information you can access (your team and all your teammates' grades).
2. All responses are in `json` format which you learned how to parse last lab. 
3. We are using a very simple authentication method, by passing our API `token` in the request headers.
When you use some real-world APIs, you will see some more sophisticated authentication techniques.
